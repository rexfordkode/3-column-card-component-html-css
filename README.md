## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma

### The above in more detail

I first imported all the images from the design folder into Figma so I can begin to gauge the sizes of margins, padding, overall size, text size and more. Once I have added all the sizes to my notes I then begin with the HTML document.

I used the HTML5 markup as a foundation to layout the structure of the website.

Because I'm very familiar with flexbox and grid at the moment I went with flexbox as I'm a little more confident in flexbox than grid.

I decided to go with the Mobile-first approach and then work on my desktop view. I didn't quite come right with inbetween sizes but I'm still learning. I then moved onto my css document.

### What I learned

I've learnt that things are all ways as easy as they look and it takes both work and practice to get good. I'm also one step closer to becoming more confident in flexbox thanks to this project.

### Continued development

I will still continue my studies and when I've become a master of flexbox I'll reattempt this challenge.
